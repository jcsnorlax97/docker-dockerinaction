- What **Docker** is.
- An introduction to **containers**.
- How Docker addresses **software problems** that most people tolerate.
- **When**, **where**, and **why** you should use Docker.
- Example: "Hello, World"

## 2. Summary

This chapter has been a brief introduction to Docker and the problems it helps system administrators, developers, and other software users solve. In this chapter you learned that:

- Docker takes a logistical approach to solving common software problems and **simplifies** your experience with installing, running, publishing, and removing software. It's a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services. It's integrated with community tools provided by Docker Inc.

- The **container abstraction** is at the core of its logistical approach.

- Working with containers instead of software creates a consistent **interface** and enables the development of more sophisticated tools.

- Containers help keep your computer **tidy** because software inside containers can't interact with anything outside those containers, and no shared dependencies can be formed.

- Because Docker is available and supported on Linux, OS X, and Windows, most software packaged in Docker images can be used on any computer. Docker helps improving **portability**.

- Docker doesn't provide container technology; it hides the complexity of working directly with the container software.
